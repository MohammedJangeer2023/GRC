            <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish an Information Security Management System (ISMS) at MJ Residence. I have established an ISMS in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001 (“ISO 27001”) that governs the processes required to protect home and information assets. This document specifies the scope of the ISMS and PIMS at MJ Residence.</p>
            <h3>Policy Scope</h3>
            <p>The policy applies to all home software and hardware infrastructure, devices, systems, and data, covers all home products and services, and must be adhered to by all residents and contractors.</p>

            <h3>Policy Objective</h3>
            <p>The objective of my Executive Management is to continually strengthen and improve the overall capabilities of the ISMS, to increase professional skills in terms of information security management and technology, to make the MJ Residence management system so complete that reliable certification standards are effective, to ensure information-related operations continue to meet certification standards, and to establish a sustainable operation plan that is cost-effective. Specific objectives include:</p>

                <li>Information is only accessible to authorized persons.</li>
                <li>Confidentiality of information is maintained.</li>
                <li>Integrity of information is maintained throughout the process.</li>
                <li>Business continuity plans are established, maintained, and tested.</li>

                <li>All breaches of information security and suspected weaknesses are reported and investigated.</li>
                <li>Procedures exist to support the policy, including virus control measures, passwords, and continuity plans.</li>
                <li>Business requirements for the availability of information and systems will be met.</li>
                <li>I am responsible for maintaining the policy and providing support and advice during its implementation.</li>
                <li>All managers are directly responsible for implementing the policy and ensuring resident compliance in their respective areas.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Scope of the ISMS</h3>
            <p>The scope of the ISO 27001 certification is limited to the ISMS supporting the assets, technologies, and processes employed by MJ Residence located at [Residence Location]. This includes the protection of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.</p>
            <h3>Assets</h3>
            <p>The assets of the ISMS include information, application, database, cloud services, and personnel:</p>

                <li>Locations</li>
                <li>Home locations</li>
                <li>Departments</li>
