            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This page discusses how cyber adversaries can leverage distractions and manipulate circumstances to infiltrate target networks. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

        <section id="adversarial-techniques">
            <h2>Adversarial Techniques</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>DDoS Attacks as Cover:</strong> Attackers can use DDoS attacks to overwhelm security systems, hindering their ability to detect other malicious activity on the network.</li>
                <li><strong>Exploiting Service Disruptions:</strong> Adversaries can target service providers or infrastructure to create disruptions that distract security teams and potentially open windows for infiltration.</li>
                <li><strong>Patch and Update Vulnerabilities:</strong> Attackers might wait for the release of faulty patches or updates to exploit vulnerabilities created during troubleshooting processes.</li>
                <li><strong>Infiltrating During Acquisitions:</strong> Mergers and acquisitions can create confusion and introduce new systems that are not yet fully secured, making them vulnerable targets.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Access at Events:</strong> Attackers can blend into crowds at conferences or vendor events to gain physical access to a target network.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="defensive-strategies">
            <h2>Defensive Strategies</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Layered Security:</strong> Implementing multiple layers of security controls can make it more difficult for attackers to exploit any single weakness.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Awareness Training:</strong> Train security personnel to be aware of these adversarial tactics and to remain vigilant during disruptive events.</li>
                <li><strong>Threat Modeling and Risk Management:</strong> Proactively identify potential attack scenarios and develop mitigation strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Change Management Protocols:</strong> Establish clear procedures for handling system changes and updates to minimize security risks during these processes.</li>
                <li><strong>Penetration Testing:</strong> Conduct regular penetration testing exercises to identify vulnerabilities in security controls and incident response capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Contingency Planning:</strong> Develop plans for responding to security incidents that occur during disruptive events.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="security-controls">
            <h2>Security Controls and Mitigations (NIST 800-53)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AC-14:</strong> Permitted Actions Without Identification or Authentication: Define acceptable security measures for emergencies when standard authentication protocols may be bypassed.</li>
                <li><strong>AC-20:</strong> Use of External Information Systems: Establish policies for using external systems, especially during critical situations, to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
                <li><strong>CA-8:</strong> Penetration Testing: Conduct penetration testing exercises that simulate real-world attack scenarios, including those that leverage distractions.</li>
                <li><strong>CP-2:</strong> Contingency Plan: Integrate adversary awareness and threat hunting practices into contingency plans for various disruptive events.</li>
                <li><strong>CP-3:</strong> Contingency Training: Include penetration testing during contingency training to assess security measures during emergencies.</li>
                <li><strong>CP-7:</strong> Alternate Processing Site: Evaluate the security risks associated with resuming operations at backup sites and implement safeguards.</li>
                <li><strong>IR-2:</strong> Incident Response Training: Train security personnel to identify and respond to security incidents, including those that occur during disruptions.</li>
                <li><strong>PE-3:</strong> Physical Access Control: Enforce stricter physical access controls during situations with a high volume of visitors or limited oversight.</li>
                <li><strong>PE-10:</strong> Emergency Shutoff: Develop a capability to shut down information systems if a security compromise is suspected during an emergency.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                By understanding these adversarial tactics and implementing appropriate security measures, organizations can significantly improve their ability to defend against cyberattacks, even during disruptive events.
