            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In cybersecurity, forensic analysis of a compromised system is crucial for understanding the attacker's methods and motives. Traditionally, forensic imaging is done after an incident to preserve evidence without altering the system. However, live analysis offers a different approach.

            <h2>The Current Threat Landscape: A Complex Ecosystem</h2>
            <p>The cybersecurity landscape is constantly evolving, with new threats emerging alongside the development of defensive technologies. Here's a breakdown of some key players and considerations:</p>
            <h3>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Highly skilled and well-funded adversaries:</strong> APTs are often backed by nation-states or sophisticated criminal organizations. They target specific organizations for long-term espionage, intellectual property theft, or disruption.</li>
                <li><strong>Stealthy and persistent:</strong> APTs employ sophisticated techniques to evade detection and maintain access to compromised systems for extended periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Tailored attacks:</strong> Unlike mass malware campaigns, APTs meticulously research their targets and craft customized attacks exploiting specific vulnerabilities.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Evolving Attack Methods:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supply Chain Attacks:</strong> Hackers target software vendors or service providers to infiltrate a wider range of organizations using their products. (e.g., SolarWinds supply chain attack)</li>
                <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Continues to be a major threat, with attackers targeting critical infrastructure and demanding exorbitant ransoms.</li>
                <li><strong>Fileless Malware:</strong> These attacks exploit legitimate system functions to avoid traditional signature-based detection.</li>
                <li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT) Threats:</strong> The proliferation of vulnerable IoT devices creates new entry points for attackers into networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Engineering:</strong> Preying on human behavior, attackers use phishing emails, phone calls, and other tactics to trick victims into revealing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Factors Shaping the Threat Landscape:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Geopolitical Tensions:</strong> Cyber espionage and attacks are increasingly used as tools of international competition.</li>
                <li><strong>Cloud Adoption:</strong> While offering flexibility, cloud environments introduce new security challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Remote Work:</strong> The rise of remote workforces expands the attack surface as employees use personal devices and networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Emerging Technologies:</strong> As artificial intelligence and machine learning become more prevalent, attackers may exploit vulnerabilities in these technologies.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Navigating the Threat Landscape:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Threat Intelligence:</strong> Staying informed about current attack methods and vulnerabilities is crucial for proactive defense.</li>
                <li><strong>Zero Trust Security:</strong> Implementing a "never trust, always verify" approach minimizes the attack surface and potential damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Awareness Training:</strong> Educating employees about cyber threats and best practices is essential to prevent social engineering attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Patch Management:</strong> Regularly patching vulnerabilities in software and operating systems is critical to thwart known exploits.</li>
                <li><strong>Incident Response Planning:</strong> Having a well-defined plan for responding to cyberattacks helps minimize downtime and damage.</li>
            </ul>
