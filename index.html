            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Thank you for viewing the Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) section of Cyber Threat Intelligence 101. Here, you will find detailed documentation on the risk assessment, risk register, ISMS, and vulnerability management of my network, all aligned with the ISO 27001:2022 framework.</p>
            
            <h3>Risk Register</h3>
            <p>The risk register is a comprehensive document that lists all identified risks associated with my network. Each risk is described, along with its potential impact, likelihood, and mitigation strategies. I conducted a thorough analysis using industry-standard tools such as:</p>
           
            <ul>
                <li>Nessus for vulnerability scanning and identifying potential threats.</li>
                <li>Qualys for assessing the risk posture of our network and prioritising remediation efforts.</li>
                <li>Sentinel for monitoring and analysing security events in real-time.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>I regularly update the risk register to reflect new findings and changes in the network environment.</p>

            <h3>Risk Assessment</h3>
            <p>The risk assessment process involves evaluating the identified risks to determine their potential impact on the organisation. I used the following steps:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Identifying assets and their value to the organisation.</li>
                <li>Determining potential threats and vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>Assessing the likelihood and impact of each risk.</li>
                <li>Prioritising risks based on their overall score.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Security tools such as Archer and RiskWatch were instrumental in conducting these assessments. These tools helped me maintain a dynamic and up-to-date risk assessment that guides my security strategy and resource allocation.</p>

            <h3>Vulnerability Management</h3>
            <p>My vulnerability management process is designed to identify, evaluate, and mitigate vulnerabilities in my network. This process includes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Regularly scanning the network using tools like Nessus and OpenVAS.</li>
                <li>Analysing scan results to prioritise vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact.</li>
                <li>Applying patches and configuration changes to mitigate identified vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li>Conducting follow-up scans to ensure vulnerabilities have been effectively mitigated.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This ongoing process ensures that I address vulnerabilities promptly and reduce the risk of exploitation.</p>

            <h3>Information Security Management System (ISMS)</h3>
            <p>The ISMS documentation outlines the policies, procedures, and controls implemented to manage and protect my information assets (it is based on a fictitious company called MJ Residence). It includes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Security Policies: Clearly defined policies for information security, access control, incident response, and more.</li>
                <li>Procedures: Detailed procedures for implementing and maintaining security controls.</li>
                <li>Controls: Technical and administrative controls to protect information assets.</li>
                <li>Audit and Review: Regular audits and reviews to ensure compliance with the ISMS and identify areas for improvement.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I used the ISO 27001:2022 framework as a guideline to establish and maintain our ISMS. Regular updates and reviews ensure that the ISMS remains effective and aligned with my organisation's security objectives.</p>
